Staff was very helpful and friendly.","0","0","0"

We had their beef tartar and pork belly to start and a salmon dish and lamb meal for mains. Everything was incredible! I could go on at length about how all the listed ingredients really make their dishes amazing but honestly you just need to go. 

A bit outside of downtown montreal but take the metro out and it's less than a 10 minute walk from the station.","0","0","0"

They are known for smoked meat which most deli's have but their brisket sandwich is what I come to montreal for. They've got about 12 seats outside to go along with the inside.
