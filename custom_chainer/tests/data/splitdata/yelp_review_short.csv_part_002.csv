We had their beef tartar and pork belly to start and a salmon dish and lamb meal for mains. Everything was incredible! I could go on at length about how all the listed ingredients really make their dishes amazing but honestly you just need to go.

A bit outside of downtown montreal but take the metro out and it's less than a 10 minute walk from the station.","0","0","0"
