"While looking at different restaurants in the area, came upon this restaurant posting and decided to try it, as it is down the street from work.

Not bad when you want something slightly cheaper than Congee Star. It is a mix of chinese and choy suey menu."
"Not sure what the hype is, but decided to give this a try based on all the reviews.

Maybe it was too hyped up, but it wasn't as amazing as I thought it would be. Maybe it was what we had ordered, but it was just ok. We had ordered the kimchi fries, which was kind of like a NY Fries ""the works"". The grilled pork banh mi was ok.

Will be back to try other stuff, like the bao version and the pork belly."
