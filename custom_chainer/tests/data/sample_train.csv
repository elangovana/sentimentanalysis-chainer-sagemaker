Staff was very helpful and friendly.","0","0","0"

We had their beef tartar and pork belly to start and a salmon dish and lamb meal for mains. Everything was incredible! I could go on at length about how all the listed ingredients really make their dishes amazing but honestly you just need to go.

A bit outside of downtown montreal but take the metro out and it's less than a 10 minute walk from the station.","0","0","0"

They are known for smoked meat which most deli's have but their brisket sandwich is what I come to montreal for. They've got about 12 seats outside to go along with the inside.

The smoked meat is up there in quality and taste with Schwartz's and you'll find less tourists at Lester's as well.","0","0","0"

The food speaks for itself, so good. Burgers are made to order and the meat is put on the grill when you order your sandwich. Getting the small burger just means 1 patty, the regular is a 2 patty burger which is twice the deliciousness.

Getting the Cajun fries adds a bit of spice to them and whatever size you order they always throw more fries (a lot more fries) into the bag.","0","0","0"

If you're looking for a light breakfast then head out here. Perfect spot for a coffee\/latt√© before heading out to the old port","0","0","0"

Each bar was more fun than the last. Downtown Las Vegas has changed so much and for the better. We had a wide age range in this group from early 20's to mid 50's and everyone had so much fun! Our driver Tony was knowledgable , friendly and just plain fun! Would recommend this to anyone looking to do something different away from the strip. You won't be disappointed!","1","0","0"

Not quite the same as Chinatown in terms of pricing (slightly higher) but definitely one of the better Vietnamese restaurants outside of the neighbourhood. When I don't have time to go to Chinatown, this is the next best thing as it is down the street from me.

So far the only items I have tried are the phos (beef, chicken & vegetarian) - and they have not disappointed me! Especially the chicken pho.

Next time I go back, I'm going to try the banh cuon (steamed rice noodle) and the vermicelli!","0","0","2"

Cute, quaint coffee shop with nice muskoka chairs outside.

Haven't done the poutine taste test yet with smoke's but Im excited to see which is better. However poutini's might win as they are vegan and gluten-free","1","0","0"

Peggy is great with dogs and does a great job! She is very patience with him and will make any adjustments you need before you leave the store. My little guy has no problems coming here.

They also have very good bully sticks (the non-smelly ones) that my little guy and his friends love!","3","0","0"

We come here in the morning for dim sum. They are not the cart pushing type of dim sum, it is order off of the sheet. Dim sum is not bad and not expensive either.

We also frequent the dinner scene. Their set dinner menu is not bad. We typically order a 6 dish menu and it's big enough to feed a family of 9 with leftovers.

Overall, food is pretty tasty!","1","0","0"

For Valentine's Day my boyfriend had ordered roses with Tidy's. However, the flowers that were delivered was not what he had ordered. He had placed in an order for long stem roses, mixed with orchids and was charged for that. What had showed up was a small vase with 4 short cut roses and some greens - table ornament, not really Valentine's Day flowers.

In speaking with another friend, something similar happened to her - her fiancee had ordered a dozen of roses for her for Valentine's Day while he was in Germany as a surprise and they never showed up. So when he called them to complaint, they actually then called up my friend to confirm whether or not she had received the flowers. Which she didn't, so they said they would resend - only to have them deliver it to the wrong place.

Understanding that Valentine's Day is the most busiest day for florists and mistakes do happen, the way they had handled it was not what would have been expected from a florist of that nature.","9","0","1"
"lsoSqIrrDbQvWpMvsSj2xw","u0LXt3Uea_GidxRW1xcsfg","RtUvSWO_UZ8V3Wpj0n077w","3","2012-12-03","Wanted to check out this place due to all the hype I had heard. My friend wanted to come here for her birthday. We had a group of seven and based on the way the seating works (as it is communal), we wind up sharing with another group of five.

Food was ok - not sure what the hype was. Almost 75% of the dishes had some sort of cheese in it.

This place is very loud so not ideal for catching up\/talking. Not a great place to go if you have any gluten or vegan restrictions.

Interesting concept. Would definitely recommend to try this place once - but definitely not worth the 30- 45 mins wait.","2","1","1"

My two favourite dishes are the rice flour rolls and the chicken pho. The rice flour rolls are always fresh whenever I'm there! And the chicken pho is always flavourful!! mmmm....just thinking of it makes me want some!

My boyfriend is Vietnamese and he agrees that this place is authentic and one of the best Vietnamese restaurants he has ever eaten at.

Prices are very reasonable too!","2","0","1"

I was in Mtl for the weekend and wind up eating here 2 nights in a row!

The sandwiches here are unbelieveable! The smoked meat is so tasty and salty but so good. The bread definitely complements the meat!

Not much of a line up if you come either later in the evening.

Remember to leave a tip in the plate when you order take out and the servers will be extra nice and funny!","0","0","0"

Ordered the original was was ok, wasn't as amazing as everyone says it to be. I think the veggie option would have been better.

A little pricy for a take-out burger.","4","0","0"
