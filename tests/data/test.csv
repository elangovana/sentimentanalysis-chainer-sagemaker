Fruits and veggies look so good! Too bad we didn't have a kitchen at our hotel room, cause we would have bought and cooked up a storm!!

lots of varieties of apples!","0","0","1"

Not bad when you want something slightly cheaper than Congee Star. It is a mix of chinese and choy suey menu.","0","0","1"

We had ordered the eggspectation omelette and eggs benedict. The omelette was bland, overcooked. The eggs benedict were ok, but I've had better. The portion size has come down.

Overall, food and service has gone downhill and not worth my time anymore.","0","0","0"

Maybe it was too hyped up, but it wasn't as amazing as I thought it would be. Maybe it was what we had ordered, but it was just ok. We had ordered the kimchi fries, which was kind of like a NY Fries ""the works"". The grilled pork banh mi was ok.

Will be back to try other stuff, like the bao version and the pork belly.","0","0","0"

We are a big fan of the Canadan Pooch line and they carry a variety of jackets and sweaters here. And it's not just for big dogs - they have different sizes to fit all different size dogs.

Good selection of treats and food as well!","0","0","0"

Surprisingly this place is pretty big to seat a big group of 12 and still have a few more small tables available. They are mainly a take-out restaurant, as many of the customers came in for take-out, and the service was a little bit slow. However, the food was great and it accommodating for many different people - seafood lovers, vegans, etc.

Definitely recommend the basil fried rice and the fried sole fish with eggplant but for those curry lovers out there, stay away from the roti curry chicken - no curry taste, just coconut favour. But the Roti itself was really good.

Most of the dishes were under $10 - definitely a good deal!

Will be back to try the noodle dishes!","4","0","0"

It's expensive and the food is disgusting. You have to order the sushi at the table, but everything else (i.e. salads, soups, cooked food) you can get up and go get it yourself.

The food is very bland, the sushi does not taste like anything - not even sure if the fish is fresh.

On the weekends, everyone seems to be there for the snow crab legs - if that's what you are coming for, forget it! You have to fight\/wait in-line to get it. It's probably easier to eat it at Mandarin.

If anyone suggests to go there, I highly recommend you go somewhere else!","3","0","0"

As soon as we walked in, my dog was greeted with treats! He was so excited to explore the store...

There are 4 seats that you can sit and have your coffee while your dog lounges in the dog bed in front of you.

Truth - this really a store for dogs, not so much for humans even though they offer coffee and tea - but just a handful of choices, nothing crazy :)

The great part is my dog is very picky when it comes to his treats and he really likes the one we had purchased here. Guess we will be back for more...","0","0","0"

The decor is definitely interesting. Although, the outside has lots of lights as decoration, the inside is kind of dark. The red lighting and orange menu makes it hard to read.

The food is not bad. Although they tell you that the vegetarian platter is only for one person - this platter is definitely made for sharing!","1","0","1"

Love that it has a nice indoor salt water pool for the doggies to use. It is small, and only meant for 1 dog at a time. I have a small little one that makes this size work well for him, but not sure how the bigger dogs can really swim in here.

The pool is great as the water is lukewarm so my little guy is willing to go in (as we have been to another indoor pool which the water is cold).

For the 1st time users, they have an instructor there to help assess what your dog can do or not do, that way you don't scared them off from swimming.

After that, you are free to book time for just you and your pup.

And they have a tub outside of the pool to bath them when they are done.

Overall, no complaints with them!","0","0","0"
