They are known for smoked meat which most deli's have but their brisket sandwich is what I come to montreal for. They've got about 12 seats outside to go along with the inside.

The smoked meat is up there in quality and taste with Schwartz's and you'll find less tourists at Lester's as well.","0","0","0"
